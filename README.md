# CourseXray
Insight Data Science project 2017

CourseXray is a web app to (1) help you find online data science courses based on flexible keywords and (2) analyze reviewer sentiment on any keyword or aspect of a course that interests you. CourseXray searches both course descriptions and course reviews to help you perform a more targeted and flexible search.

 For example, you can search for "machine learning python" and get back the top five courses based on a Tf-idf analysis of both course descriptions and course reviews.  CourseXray will show you how strongly each word was associated with your top result.  You may then enter any other keyword into the Xray to see a sentiment analysis of that keyword from course reviews.  This lets you see how previous students feel about other aspects of the course, such as instructor, homework, assignments, etc.

 CourseXray was built on a 3-4 week timescale and uses natural language processing techniques in python to analyze text.  It uses Flask/Bootstrap to create the web app.
